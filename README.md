# Sallen Key Band Pass Filter Design and Implementation

## Description  
This repository contains the project report, simulation details, and hardware implementation for a *Sallen Key/Cascaded Band Pass Filter* designed as part of the ELCT 401: Electric Circuits II course. The project involved designing, simulating, and building a band-pass filter to meet specified frequency characteristics using the Sallen Key topology. Key deliverables include theoretical calculations, PSpice simulations, and oscilloscope results from the hardware prototype.

## Theoretical Background  
The Sallen Key band-pass filter is a cascaded active filter combining high-pass and low-pass stages. Key equations:  
- **Lower Cutoff Frequency**:  
  *fL = 1 / (2 * œÄ * ‚àö2 * R1 * C1)*  
- **Higher Cutoff Frequency**:  
  *fH = 1 / (2 * œÄ * ‚àö2 * R2 * C2)*  
- **Center Frequency**:  
  *f0 = ‚àö(fL * fH)*

## Filter Design  
### Component Values  
| Component | Value       |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| R1        | *1 kŒ©*      |  
| R2        | *100 kŒ©*    |  
| C1        | *10 nF*     |  
| C2        | *22 pF*     |  

### Calculated Frequencies  
- *fL = 11.25 kHz*  
- *fH = 51.15 kHz*  
- *f0 = 23.99 kHz*  

### Simulated Results (PSpice)  
- Lower cutoff (*f1*): *11.9 kHz*  
- Center frequency (*f0*): *24 kHz*  
- Upper cutoff (*f2*): *39 kHz*

## Simulation  
### Tools & Settings  
- **Software**: PSpice (OrCAD Capture).  
- **AC Sweep Profile**:  
  - Frequency Range: *100 Hz ‚Äì 500 kHz* (Logarithmic).  
  - Input Signal: *1 V AC*.  
- **Time Domain Profile**:  
  - Input Signal: *Vsin* at *f < f0*, *f = f0*, *f > f0*.  
  - Run Time: *1 ms*.  

### Expected Outcomes  
- **AC Sweep**: Gain *vs.* frequency plot showing band-pass behavior.  
- **Time Domain**: Output voltage amplitude peaking at *f0*.

## Hardware Implementation  
### Components Used  
- Resistors: *3√ó1 kŒ©*, *2√ó100 kŒ©*.  
- Capacitors: *2√ó10 nF*, *3√ó22 pF*.  
- Op-Amps: *2√óLM741*.  
- Breadboard, wires.  

### Key Steps  
1. Cascaded high-pass (HPF) and low-pass (LPF) stages on a breadboard.  
2. Validated output using an oscilloscope at *f = 11.9 kHz*, *24 kHz*, and *39 kHz*.

## Results  
### Simulation vs. Hardware  
| Parameter       | Calculated    | Simulated     | Hardware      |  
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|  
| Center Frequency | *23.99 kHz*   | *24 kHz*      | *24 kHz*      |  

### Oscilloscope Outputs  
- ***f < f0*** (*11.9 kHz*): Attenuated output.  
- ***f = f0*** (*24 kHz*): Maximum gain.  
- ***f > f0*** (*39 kHz*): Attenuated output.
