# Sallen Key Band Pass Filter Design and Implementation

## Description
This repository contains the project report, simulation details, and hardware implementation for a **Sallen Key/Cascaded Band Pass Filter** designed as part of the ELCT 401: Electric Circuits II course. The project involved designing, simulating, and building a band-pass filter to meet specified frequency characteristics using the Sallen Key topology. Key deliverables include theoretical calculations, PSpice simulations, and oscilloscope results from the hardware prototype.

## Theoretical Background
The Sallen Key band-pass filter is a cascaded active filter combining high-pass and low-pass stages. Key equations:  
- **Lower Cutoff Frequency**:  
  \( f_L = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{2} R_1 C_1} \)  
- **Higher Cutoff Frequency**:  
  \( f_H = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{2} R_2 C_2} \)  
- **Center Frequency**:  
  \( f_0 = \sqrt{f_L \cdot f_H} \)

## Filter Design
### Component Values
| Component | Value       |
|-----------|-------------|
| R1        | 1 kŒ©        |
| R2        | 100 kŒ©      |
| C1        | 10 nF       |
| C2        | 22 pF       |

### Calculated Frequencies
- \( f_L = 11.25 \, \text{kHz} \)
- \( f_H = 51.15 \, \text{kHz} \)
- \( f_0 = 23.99 \, \text{kHz} \)

### Simulated Results (PSpice)
- Lower cutoff (\( f_1 \)): 11.9 kHz  
- Center frequency (\( f_0 \)): 24 kHz  
- Upper cutoff (\( f_2 \)): 39 kHz

## Simulation
### Tools & Settings
- **Software**: PSpice (OrCAD Capture).  
- **AC Sweep Profile**:  
  - Frequency Range: 100 Hz ‚Äì 500 kHz (Logarithmic).  
  - Input Signal: 1 V AC.  
- **Time Domain Profile**:  
  - Input Signal: Vsin at \( f < f_0 \), \( f = f_0 \), \( f > f_0 \).  
  - Run Time: 1 ms.  

### Expected Outcomes
- **AC Sweep**: Gain vs. frequency plot showing band-pass behavior.  
- **Time Domain**: Output voltage amplitude peaking at \( f_0 \).

## Hardware Implementation
### Components Used
- Resistors: 3√ó1 kŒ©, 2√ó100 kŒ©.  
- Capacitors: 2√ó10 nF, 3√ó22 pF.  
- Op-Amps: 2√óLM741.  
- Breadboard, wires.  

### Key Steps
1. Cascaded high-pass (HPF) and low-pass (LPF) stages on a breadboard.  
2. Validated output using an oscilloscope at \( f = 11.9 \, \text{kHz} \), \( 24 \, \text{kHz} \), and \( 39 \, \text{kHz} \).

## Results
### Simulation vs. Hardware
| Parameter       | Calculated | Simulated | Hardware |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Center Frequency | 23.99 kHz  | 24 kHz    | 24 kHz  |

### Oscilloscope Outputs
- **\( f < f_0 \)** (11.9 kHz): Attenuated output.  
- **\( f = f_0 \)** (24 kHz): Maximum gain.  
- **\( f > f_0 \)** (39 kHz): Attenuated output.
